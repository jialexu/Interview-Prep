Hi, my name is Jiale Xu. I recently earned my Master’s in Computer Science from UC San Diego, where I also completed a Bachelor’s in Mathematics and Computer Science with a minor in Management Science. I’ve developed a strong foundation in full-stack development, distributed systems, and AI-driven applications.

I recently interned at SVIEF, where I built and maintained their official website using WordPress, PHP, and MySQL, improving both performance and user engagement. Before that, I worked at a startup, developing a shopping platform with Java Spring Boot and frontend technologies, and earlier at Asia Info, I built an AI-powered writing assistant using Java, Python, and Kubernetes.

On the systems side, I independently developed a distributed file storage system in C++, implementing the RAFT consensus algorithm with 2PC to ensure robust leader election, log replication, and >99.99% availability.

I'm especially interested in backend infrastructure, generative AI, and building reliable, scalable systems.
